# SemText — static marketing site (semtext.dev) + component demos, served by nginx.
#
# Two stages:
#   builder     — node, runs `npm ci && npm run build` to produce dist/
#   production  — nginx:alpine serving dist/site at / and dist/demo at /demo/
#
# The final stage MUST be named "production" — the fleet build tooling targets
# that stage name by contract (same as elixirgenai.dev, pos.noizu.com, ...).

# doesn't silently fall through nginx's SPA `try_files` to the landing page.

# something baked into an image sha — unset means no analytics at all.
