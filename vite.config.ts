/**
 * Shared dev/preview config. The BUILD does not go through this file.
 *
 * This package emits three independent IIFE artifacts (semtext.js,
 * semtext-fallback.js, semtext-extract.js) and `build.lib` with `formats: ['iife']`
 * accepts a single entry, so `npm run build` drives the Vite JS API from
 * scripts/build.mjs instead. Build options live there, next to the size
 * budgets they are checked against.
 *
 * `vite preview` serves `dist/` as the web root, which is why the cypress
 * baseUrl resolves `/demo/index.html` to `dist/demo/index.html` — the BUILT
 * page, not the marker source in `web/demo/`.

  // Unit tier (vitest). Coverage is measured over the whole shipped source
  // tree, not just the files the unit specs happen to import, so the number
  // is honest: most of src/ is exercised only by the cypress e2e suite, which
  // is not instrumented. The threshold is a ratchet (unit line % minus 5,
  // floored) — raise it as unit coverage grows; see docs/TEST-HEALTH.md.
